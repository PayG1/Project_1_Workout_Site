<h1 class="home-body">What Are Some Benefits of Exercise?</h1>

<p>Experts recommend that teens get 60 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day. Here are some reasons why:</p>
    <br>
        <ul>
    <li><strong> Exercise benefits every part of the body, including the mind.</strong> Exercise improves brain health and learning. It can help people sleep better. 
        When you exercise, your body makes chemicals that help you feel good. Exercise lowers your chances of depression and decreases feelings of anxiety. 
        Plus, exercise can give you a real sense of accomplishment and pride at having achieved a goal — like mastering a new dance routine or beating an old time in the 100-meter dash.</li>
        <br>
    <li><strong> Exercise helps people keep a healthy weight and lower their risk of some diseases.</strong> Exercising regularly can help prevent weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. 
        Bone-strengthening exercise — like jumping, running, or lifting weights — can help keep bones strong.</li>
        <br>
    <li><strong>Exercise can help a person age well.</strong> This may not seem important now, but your body will thank you later. Regular exercise improves quality of life,the ability to enjoy things,as you get older. 
        It can improve brain health and reduce the chance of getting Alzheimer`s and can help prevent falls and injuries from falls.</li>
    </ul>

<h1 class="home-body">Why Strength Training?</h1>

<p> The heart isn't the only muscle to benefit from regular exercise. The other muscles in your body enjoy exercise too. When you use your muscles, they become stronger.
    Strong muscles are also a plus because they support your joints and help prevent injuries. Muscle-strengthening activities can also be bone-strengthening.
    You don't have to lift weights to make your muscles and bones stronger. Different types of exercise strengthen different muscle groups. For example:</p>
    <br>
        <ul>
            <li>For arms, try rowing or cross-country skiing. Pull-ups and push-ups, those old gym class standbys, are also good for building arm muscles.</li>
            <br>
            <li>For strong legs, try running, biking, rowing, or skating. Squats and leg raises also work the legs.</li>
            <br>
            <li>For abdominal and core strength, you can't beat rowing, yoga or pilates, and planks and crunches.</li>
        </ul>
    <h1 class="home-body">How Can I Keep It Going?</h1>
        <p> One of the biggest reasons people drop an exercise program is lack of interest: If what you're doing isn't fun, it's hard to keep it up. But there are many different sports and activities to try to see which one inspires you. 
        If you need a little more motivation, take a class, join a team, or find an exercise buddy to help keep you on track.
        Talk to someone, like a coach or fitness expert at a gym, who can help you get started on a program that's right for you and your level of fitness.
        Everyone can benefit from moving more and sitting less, even those with disabilities or medical problems like asthma. If you have a health problem or other concern (like being out of shape), talk to your doctor before beginning an exercise plan.
        Considering all the health benefits of being physically active, it's easy to see why exercise is wise. And the great thing about exercise is that it's never too late to start. 
        Even small things can count as exercise — like taking a short bike ride, walking the dog, or raking leaves. If you are new to exercise, start with a few minutes a day and slowly build to the recommended amount of at least 60 minutes.
