## Testing
  - I confirmed that the website runs in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera
  
  - I have tested that the website is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes
  
  - All grammatical errors have been corrected.

 -Bugs
  - Fixed a bug where the site did not load the videos because it couldn't find them: It was because I used a forward slash before specifying the file location. Removing it fixed the issue.
  
  - Fixed an issue where the correct spacing wasn't applied to the paragraph: It was because I forgot to close the tags. Closing them fixed the issue
  
  - Fixed a bug where the CSS wasn't targetting the correct class: It was because there was a space in the class declaration. Putting a dash to separate the words fixed the issue.

 -Validator Testing
  - HTML: No errors were found when put through W3C Validator
  - CSS: No errors were found when put through W3C Validator
  - Accessibility: High score in accessibility given by lighthouse in the dev tools.
